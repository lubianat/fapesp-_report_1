# Achievements 


In the first year of the project, we addressed 3 different facets of the project. 
The first facet dealt with the concept of cell type itself, in the goal of building theoretical models for the formalization of knowledge. 
The second facet was aimed at the practical application of the concepts. 
We adapted a public database of cell type markers, Panglao DB, to the Wikidata format, made the information available through Wikidata and perfomed SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) queries to glance at the information on the database. 
Finally, we manually annotated articles in the Human Cell Atlas Publications collection to gain insights on the types of knowledge available about cell types and paving the way for automated and crowdsourced approaches. 

## Concept of cell types

The definition of the concept of "cell type" is currently a topic of debate by the biomedical community.[@wikidata:Q87649649; @doi:10.1242/dev.169854; @doi:10.1242/dev.178996; @wikidata:Q47565008; @wikidata:Q99418657; @wikidata:Q98665291; @wikidata:Q93086971; @wikidata:Q26770736; @wikidata:Q35688096; @wikidata:Q98633613; @wikidata:Q99418649; @wikidata:Q40436539].
In an opinion article published in Cell Systems in 2017, a series of researchers presented their views on the conceptual definition of 'cell type' in the context of a mature organism [@wikidata:Q87649649].
Many scientists believed that cell functions have a core role in defining cell types, which is a slippery road, as the very meaning of "function" in biology is elusive [@doi:10.7554/eLife.47014].
The opinions were varied, and no consensus was achieved.


As much as different concepts of species coexist [@doi:10.1080/10635150701701083], our quest to define cell types may take various forms.
The challenge of representing cell types in the context of evolution is conceptually different from representing cell types in biomedical experimentation.
In that second direction, the groundwork of the Cell Ontology [@wikidata:Q21184168; @doi:10.1186/1471-2105-12-6; @doi:10.1186/s13326-016-0088-7] and   CELDA [@wikidata:Q21284308]  and the contributions of the International Workshop on Cells in Experimental Life Sciences series [@doi:10.1186/s12859-017-1976-2; @doi:10.1186/s12859-019-2721-9] are notable.

In this work, we targeted the question: which cell type definition allows crafting coherent biological statements? 
The goal is to not say what cell types _are_, but what they can be for a consistent representation on a knowledge graph, like Wikidata.
We also assume that biological statements that derive from experimentation should be logically valid, and thus aim to distill ways to resolve ambiguities in natural language statements makes knowledge unresolvable (i.e. neither true nor false).
Furthermore, for the practical purpose adopted here, we avoid the dissection of the differences between persistent classes of cells (often called "cell types") or the transient, fugacious classes of cells (often called "cell states") (see "Definition of cell identity" section in [@wikidata:Q48563763] for an example).
Even though such a distinction is an essential topic for theoretical research, it is not required to represent formally biomedical experiments.


To facilitate communication among life scientists, in a preprint derived from this PHD project[@doi:10.22541/au.160979530.02627436/v1], we proposed naming conventions for different cell types classes. 
Much of the literature mixes cell types in one species (e.g., when dealing with a cell type as an evolutionary unit) or multiple species (e.g., in the Cell Ontology). 
It is useful to distill these different concepts into names. Given the importance of the species' concept in biological classification [@wikidata:Q1189395], we derive a species-centric view on the naming of classes of cell types. 
The four classes (Figure @fig:classes) we propose are as follows:

- archetypes, for when the taxonomic scope of the type is beyond the level of species; for example, "mammal neutrophils."
- _sensu stricto_ cell types, for when the taxonomic scope of the type corresponds to a single species; for example, _Mus musculus_ neutrophils."
- infratypes, for when the taxonomic scope is below the level of species; for example, considering the mouse strain "C57BL/6J", "neutrophils from C57BL/6J mice". 
- technotypes, for specific, experimentally defined cell types that harbor in their definition the precise conditions of the cells sampled; “2-month-old male C57BL/6J, Ly-6G<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup>  M-CSF R<sup>-</sup>  CD244<sup>-</sup> neutrophils”.

The 4 different categories of cell types help us to better organize the knowledge about cell types. 
Even though individual articles and databases often have species-neutral names, the information often comes from experiments with a single strain of a single species.
Two articles might call by the same name cells that come from different animals, or were selected by different protocols. 
Large scale knowledge management requires an organized way of representing those details.

The division between archetypes and _sensu stricto_ cell types is of special importance in the context of biocuration and annotation of data. 
Associations like the  HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee and UniProt organize names and identifiers for genes and proteins in single species. 
Thus, if we want to annotate marker genes, for example, we need to associate them to a species-specific cell type (a _sensu stricto_ cell type) instead of the more vague association to a species-neutral type. 
That might seem obvious, but current standards still use identifiers that are species-neutral (e.g. in the reference HuBMAP app; <https://azimuth.hubmapconsortium.org/references/>)


The ontological discussion on the classes of cell types, thus, extends the current state-of-the-art and introduce new ways to organize our knowledge about cells. 
Notably, the technotype and the infratype are, currently, mostly theoretical constructs and almost no resources deal with cell types at the level of strains or below. 
The division of archetypes and _sensu stricto_ cell types, on the other hand, was already instrumental for the integration of the Panglao database of cell markers to Wikidata, described in the next session.
